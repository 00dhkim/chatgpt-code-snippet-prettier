# chatgpt-code-snippet-prettier

Why doesn't ChatGPT automatically wrap code?
So I built a free extension.

I often paste source code into ChatGPT, and even slightly long code would lead to endless scrolling, causing a pretty bad reading experience.
It got even worse when I pasted multiple files, there was no clear separation between them.

So I created an extension to fix this.
Now, your code will be nicely wrapped.

Code snippets enclosed in triple backticks (```) will automatically be collapsed under a "Load More" button.
Also, when you paste (Ctrl+V) code into the input box, the extension detects it and wraps it with triple backticks.
(Short snippets under 20 characters wonâ€™t be wrapped.)

Hope you find it useful and I'm always open to feedback!
